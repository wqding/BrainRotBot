Reformat the following story, split up long chunks of text or combine short sentences into paragraphs, separate each paragraph with "\n<--->\n"

---

Imagine you are a script writer, format the given story based on who is speaking the lines, if a character says something, then the line will be split into two parts, what the character said, and what the narrator says. Follow these rules:
1. If the speaker's name is not known, simply use a letter of the alphabet (A, B, C, etc...)
2. KEEP the paragraph formatting "\n<--->\n"
3. Each speaker should have a newline

Example input: 

“Stephen, can you get in here,” I cried.
A big dark bruise covered my hip, as If I was assaulted in my sleep with a metal bar.
“What’s wrong,” Stephen said as he came rushing into the bathroom.

Example output:

A | “Stephen, can you get in here,” I cried. :|
A | A big dark bruise covered my hip, as If I was assaulted in my sleep with a metal bar. :|
Stephen | "What’s wrong," :|
A | Stephen said as he came rushing into the bathroom. :|
